# Arch Linux w/ Hyprland Setup

This repo includes my notes & details to configure new machines the way I like them. I'm trying not to create my own ISO & just use a script or manual edits for now..

## Omarchy

Omarchy gets me a solid foundation for what I want. I'm currently using the Osaka Jade theme but also can quickly switch based on mood.

- [Omarchy Website](https://omarchy.org)
- [Omarchy Docs](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual)
- [Omarchy GitHub](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy)
- [Omarchy ISO GitHub](https://github.com/omacom-io/omarchy-iso)

## Additional Apps

On all of my devices, I use the following:

### VS Code
- Easeist to install via menu

### Telegram
- Install via AUR

## Web Apps

I find the following web apps helful. It is also good to just use keybindings to open the full browser to a specific page for others so I have the chromium navbar.

## Optional Apps

On my streaming devices, I use the following:

### GoXLR Linux

## Custom Keybindings

Files included in the /configs folder to overwrite default Omarchy configs.

## Custom ASCII Art

Files included in the /ascii folder to replace the default omarchy ascii at in /.config/omarchy/branding on the linux computers.

To create new ascii art, use [this website](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/).
